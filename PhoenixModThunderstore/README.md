## Future Plans
- Implement new skills
- Fix some bugs (in Known issues)
- Add stand alone scepter support
- add displays from SOTV
- New skins
- New achievements
- Clean up the atrocity that I call code

## Known Issues
- In multiplayer, for some goddamn reason, the normal primary spawns the prefab of the empowered primary and you have people throwing arms around, this problem only exists for clients.
